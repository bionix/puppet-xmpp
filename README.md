puppet-xmpp
===========

Description
-----------

A Puppet report handler for sending notifications of failed runs to
Jabber/XMPP.

Requirements
------------

* `xmpp4r`
* `puppet`

Installation & Usage
--------------------

1.  Install the `xmpp4r` gem on your Puppet master

        $ sudo gem install xmpp4r

2.  Install puppet-xmpp as a module in your Puppet master's module
    path.

3.  Update the `xmpp_jid`, `xmpp_passowrd`, and `xmpp_target` variables in `xmpp.yaml`
    and copy the file to `/etc/puppet`. An example file is included.

4.  Optionally change `xmpp_environment` in `xmpp.yaml`.  You can set this value to a
    string or an array of strings.  These strings are the names of acceptable environments
    to send alerts for.  If you don't change this option from the default of ALL the
    processor will send an alert for errors in all environments.

5.  Enable pluginsync and reports on your master and clients in `puppet.conf`

        [master]
        report = true
        reports = xmpp
        pluginsync = true
        [agent]
        report = true
        pluginsync = true

6.  Run the Puppet client and sync the report as a plugin
